Live.ly is a project I made during a 24-hour hackathon - Hack The Burgh VII on 6-7 March 2021 (my very first hackathon) with my friend, Amran (https://github.com/amran92). This project aims to act as an interactive browser homepage which isn't only pleasant to see, but offers some features just good enough to kick-start your day in front of the computer.

Live.ly is a "lively" or "lit" dashboard for you to look at instead of the boring browser homepage that you see every day. It presents you the latest hot news (thanks to NY Times API) in the section to your right, has a to-do app integrated in the left section, and in the mid-section, it greets you and presents random advice (thanks to Advice Slip API) of the day. Made using ReactJS, NY Times API, Advice Slip API, React Icons, Material UI, Bootstrap, CSS.
