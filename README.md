A project made with my friend during Hack The Burgh VII hackathon on 6-7 March 2021. Live.ly/Livedotly is a "lively" or "lit" dashboard for you to look at instead of your boring browser homepage that you see every day. It presents you hot news (NY Times API) in the section to your right, has a todo app integrated in the left section, and in the mid-section, it greets you and presents random advice (Advice Slip API) of the day. Made using ReactJS, NY Times API, Advice Slip API, React Icons, Material UI, Bootstrap, CSS.
