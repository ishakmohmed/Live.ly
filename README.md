A project made with my friend during a Hack The Burgh VII hackathon on 6-7 March 2021. Live.ly/Livedotly is a "lively" or "lit" dashboard for you to look at instead of your boring browser homepage that you see every day. It present you hot news on the right section, has a todo app integrated in the left section, and in the mid-section, it greets you and presents random advice of the day. Made using ReactJS, NY Times API, Advice Slip API, React Icons, Material UI, Bootstrap, CSS.
